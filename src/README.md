## Description: <br />
This program is used to either encrypt or decrypt a given phrase by shifting all letters based on a key given by the user. The program is split into four seperate parts: the main function, which contains all the call functions and houses the base variables used to run, the user interface function, which prompts the user to make a selection on the operation to be used, and the encryption/decryption functions, which shift each letter of the phrase by the key letter currently being evaluated. <br />
**Note: the program is ONLY able to detect letters (works with uppercase or lowercase). Using numbers, symbols, or other characters WILL cause the program to break/not run properly.** <br />
<br />
## How To: <br />
The program will prompt you on what steps need to be taken in order to use it. It will first prompt you to make a selection on an operation (it will show you the valid choices). Then, it it will ask you to input your phrase and the key you would like to use. The program will then do the rest of the work to determine the result.
